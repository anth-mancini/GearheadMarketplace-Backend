We'll use Heroku at the end of it all to deploy the main branch of the PHP app and FastAPI

FastAPI: https://medium.com/fastapi-tutorials/deploying-fastapi-to-heroku-cd00bdcf3be4

PHP: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/deploying-php 

Now for the PHP app:

Get a AMP for whatever system you're using and follow the steps for integrating this into phpStorm: 

https://www.jetbrains.com/help/phpstorm/installing-an-amp-package.html

recommend getting phpStorm and link your amp. You can get the deluxe ;) addition if you use your windsor account.

Before you start your MAMP server, point the root dir to the dir of the PHP app. 

For me it's something like this: Users ▹ felixi ▹ PhpstormProjects ▹ GearheadMarketplace-Frontend
